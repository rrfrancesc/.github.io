After interacting with a **Shiny application** and getting it certain state, your users may want to download a report in HTML or PDF format.
You can easily add the ability to generate a report with **knitr and rmarkdown** at the click of a button.

This app uses the rmarkdown package to compile a report template to PDF/HTML/Word, which we can download by clicking a button.

It's an easy way to report your Shiny analysis, generating a document with the selected outputs.
