Another App using the shiny package in R for interactive data visualization. **Shiny** is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications.

As a **R-Shiny developer** [(shiny)](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) I've created several apps, some of them are a *powerful interactive tool* to optimize the **Reinsurance** of a Company.

I've been working with packages **ggplot2** and **plotly** for an optimal data visualization. 

This app wants to be an useful interactive tool for the Companies in order to optimize their reinsurance Proportional structures. A solution to obtain a fully-comprehensive of your risks using different fitting techniques based on predictive models and *MonteCarlo simulations*. Embed this knowledge as an entry for an optimal use of your **reinsurance program**.   

Also, new presentation using the **shinydashboard** package.
