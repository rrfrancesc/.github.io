A new App using the shiny package in R for interactive data analytics and visualization. This App helps the insurance company to perform an analyse of his **Health Portfolio** and then optimize his reinsurance structure and select the best options to transfer the risk. So, we can easily compare XL structures with Proportional ones...  

As a **R-Shiny developer** [(shiny)](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) I've created several apps, some of them are a *powerful interactive tool* to optimize the **Reinsurance** of a Company.

I've been working with packages **ggplot2** and **plotly** for an optimal data visualization. 

This app wants to be an useful interactive tool for the Companies in order to optimize their Proportional structures. A solution to obtain a fully-comprehensive of your risks using different fitting techniques based on predictive models and *MonteCarlo simulations*.
