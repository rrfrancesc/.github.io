In this post I want to share a new APP created using the **Shiny** package in R for underwriting medical risks. 
This software helps the insurance Company to make interactive questions to evaluate the medical risks. So, questions depend on:
- Insured Age
- Insured Gender
- Product & Coverages selected
- Sum insured

Finally, using **rmarkdown**, the user can download a PDF ready to sign, with all the Q&A and much more...

As a **R-Shiny developer** [(shiny)](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) I've created several apps, some of them are a *powerful interactive tool* to optimize the **Reinsurance** of a Company.

I've been working with the **tidyverse** packages for data manipulation and using **ggplot2** and **plotly** for an optimal data visualization.
