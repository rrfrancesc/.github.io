Since a couple of years I am using the shiny package in R for interactive data visualization, as a **R-Shiny developer** [(shiny)](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) I've created several apps, some of them are a *powerful interactive tool* to optimize the **Reinsurance** of a Company.

This app wants to be an useful interactive tool for the Companies in order to optimize their reinsurance XL structures.
