Since a couple of years I am using the shiny package in R for interactive data visualization. **Shiny** is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications.

As a **R-Shiny developer** [(shiny)](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) I've created several apps, some of them are a *powerful interactive tool* to optimize the **Reinsurance** of a Company.

This app wants to be an useful interactive tool for the Companies in order to optimize their reinsurance XL structures. 

A solution oriented for actuaries and risk managers to model, valuate and develop reinsurance coverages. Also, you can use this application to work out the economic capital required by **Solvency II** under each reinsurance structure.
