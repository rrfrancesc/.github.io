**R Markdown** provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to save and execute code, and also to generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.

**R Markdown documents** are fully reproducible and support static and dynamic output formats. Use a productive notebook interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including R, Python, and SQL.

Is's an easy way to report your R works, where you can show the code if you want, and all kind of ouputs. **R Markdown package** can create diferent kind of documents like HTML, PDF, MS Word,...  

So, I strongly recommend using  **R Markdown** [](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) as a *powerful tool* for your presentations.

**R Markdown** can generate an interactive document, a new way to build Shiny apps. An interactive document is an R Markdown file that contains Shiny widgets and outputs. You write the report in markdown, and then launch it as an app with the click of a button.
