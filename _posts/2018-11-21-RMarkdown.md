**R Markdown** provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to save and execute code, and also to generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.

**R Markdown documents** are fully reproducible and support static and dynamic output formats.

A new APP using the Shiny package in R for interactive data analytics and visualization. This App helps the insurance company to perform an analyse of his **Health Portfolio** and then helps to optimize his reinsurance structure and select the best options to transfer the risk. So, we can easily compare XL structures with Proportional ones...  

As a **R-Shiny developer** [(shiny)](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) I've created several apps, some of them are a *powerful interactive tool* to optimize the **Reinsurance** of a Company.

I've been working with packages **ggplot2** and **plotly** for an optimal data visualization. 

This app wants to be an useful interactive tool for the Companies in order to optimize their Proportional structures. A solution to obtain a fully-comprehensive of your risks using different fitting techniques based on predictive models and *MonteCarlo simulations*.
