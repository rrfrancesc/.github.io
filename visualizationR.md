At *ERM Re* [(ERM)](http://ermgrupo.com), I'm doing a lot of reinsurance consulting work in **R**. Here you can see some examples of the projects developed.

## 3D Analysis: 
### Working with data visualization in 3D...
Building a 3D graphic using **R** and the **rgl package**. RGL is a 3D graphics package that produces a real-time interactive 3D plot. It allows to interactively rotate, zoom the graphics and select regions.

## Using Plotly in R: 
### Interactive charts...
The **Plotly package** is one of the best R tools to create beautiful and interactive data visualizations.
**Plotly’s R package** is very useful to make interactive heatmaps, geographic map visualizations, and sliders. And it's very easy to turn static ggplot2 visualizations into interactive Plotly visualizations with just one line of code. Here, some examples:

## Spatial Analysis: 
### Leaflet package for map data visualization...
**Leaflet** package lets you create interactive maps right from the R console. It provides a simple and fast way to host *interactive maps* online in R, requiring only a few lines of code for a basic web map. Interactive panning and zooming allows for an explorative view on your pinpointed location and it has therefore a great integration in a workflow with *Shiny*.

## Heat Maps: 
### ggplot2 package for data visualization...
A **heatmap** is a literal way of visualizing a table of numbers, where you substitute the numbers with colored cells. So, it is basically a table that has colors in place of numbers. Colors correspond to the level of the measurement. It’s very useful for finding highs and lows and sometimes, patterns.

In this example, it shows the expected XL Premium of a Reinsurance Treaty, depending on Priority and Capacity.

Another example, with frequency of use by Product, Sex and Age - Health Insurance.
