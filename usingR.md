### Spatial Analysis: Working with the leaflet package for spatial data visualization...
**Leaflet** package lets you create interactive maps right from the R console. It provides a simple and fast way to host *interactive maps* online in R, requiring only a few lines of code for a basic web map. Interactive panning and zooming allows for an explorative view on your pinpointed location and it has therefore a great integration in a workflow with *Shiny*.
